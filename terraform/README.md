### Terraform Infrastructure Code Explanation

This Terraform code is designed to create and manage resources on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It is organized into several modules for different resource types. Below is a brief overview of the sections:

1. **Google Cloud Provider Configuration**
   - The `provider` block configures the GCP provider with a project ID from a variable.

2. **BigQuery Datasets and Tables Module**
   - The `bigquery` module manages BigQuery datasets and tables. It creates instances for each dataset and sets configuration details such as project ID and table definitions.

3. **Cloud Storage Buckets Module**
   - The `buckets` module manages Cloud Storage buckets. Instances are created for defined buckets, specifying project ID, bucket name, and location.

This code allows for the dynamic creation and management of GCP resources using Terraform. For more details on the variables and specific resource configurations, refer to the code..
